# configScripts - start here for ModPi installation
To turn your Raspberry Pi (running raspian) into a Minecraft Pi Modding machine, clone this repo to your raspberry pi, then run the installation script. Once it is complete (it may take a while) reboot your pi and have fun!

Prerequisites:
1. Your OS should be raspian.
2. minecraft-pi must be installed.
3. Your pi should be a Raspberry Pi 2 or better.(This might work on B+ but has only been tested on 2)
4. You must have an internet connection on the pi. Once the pi is converted, you will not need internet to enjoy modding!

Have fun!
